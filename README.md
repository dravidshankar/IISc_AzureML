## Competition Details
### Packet Flood Detection in Switching Network using AzureML Designer

### Problem Statement
Packet flood detection in switching networks can be accomplished using machine learning algorithms. The idea is to use machine learning to identify abnormal network behavior, such as a high volume of incoming packets from a single source. The machine learning algorithm can then determine if this behavior is indicative of a network attack, such as a packet flood. This can be achieved through training the algorithm on a dataset of normal network traffic, and then using the learned patterns to detect anomalies in real-time.



### Expected Solution/Approach:
 
1.Data Collection and Dataset Preparation: The dataset may be downloaded from the following URL:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lwiUwCflAjqFyEdVbT6-rDW5q3VVddJf/view?usp=share_link

Data description is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Burst+Header+Packet+%28BHP%29+flooding+attack+on+Optical+Burst+Switching+%28OBS%29+Network

2.	Data Preparation: Perform the necessary data cleaning(if required)
3.	Feature Selection: Select the required columns after doing an analysis.
4.	Data Preprocessing: Perform any encoding of the variables to integers(if required) after analyzing the dataset
5.	Split the Data: Split the data into a training set and a validation set. 
6.	Train the model: Select suitable ML algorithms and train the model
7.	Evaluation Measures: Measures such as accuracy, mean recall score, and mean precision should be computed to evaluate the classifier's performance.
8.	Deploy the model: Deploy the model for performing real-time inferencing.
9.	Upload the results into the google form link provided below.
